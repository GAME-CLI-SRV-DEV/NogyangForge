# NogyangForge Was Originally was going to be forge-only
NogyangForge was supposed to be Forge-only Hybrid but it turned into Forge-NeoForge-Bukkit trident.

Why is that?

1. Geyser-Forge has changed to Geyser-Neoforge. due to this we still keep forge in case Neoforge removes forge. Because NogyangSpigot is also Geyser Project.
2. forge mods can be put into neoforge, but neoforge mods can't be put into forge.
3. so we combine them.

# how to setup:

download Geyser-NeoForge.jar & NogyangForge.jar & SpongeForge.jar
Spin up a server
Mod Plugin Converter Active
NogyangForge Translates forge+Neoforge mods to plugin & server side mods
if you put Geyser: You Can Start Floodgate-Core
If You put Sponge: You Can Put Sponge.
If You put ViaVersion: You Can Join Every version.
but if you do everything here: BEST SERVER EVER
